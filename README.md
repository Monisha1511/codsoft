Task 1 â€“ Personal Portfolio Website

As part of my Level 1 Task 1, I created a personal portfolio website using only HTML and CSS.

What I Did : 
Designed a responsive website structure with sections including:
Header with name and tagline
About section with profile and bio
Skills section (technical and soft skills)
Projects section showcasing academic work
Resume download link
Contact details and footer

Ensured clean layout, structured design, and beginner-friendly implementation. This task helped me strengthen my understanding of web design fundamentals and practice building a professional static website.
